GraphQL
-------
  Problems in REST API
  -------------------
  - Overfetching the data from REST API
  - Underfethcing the data from REST API
  - Exposing many api end points to Front end
  - Sharing the REST api docs to the front end developers


  Server apps
  Shell Client (cmd)
  Desktop client: Client: Browser, Postman, 
  Programming Cleint: Angular, React, (fetch / axios), vue.js, js apps, svelte


GraphQL
-------
  Server,
  Client
    Shell Client: ...?
    Web Client: GraphQL
    Desktop Client: Postman, Altair GraphQL, Client
    Programming Clients: Appolo Client, Facebook Relay in Angular/React/vuejs apps

=====
GraphQL apps
--------
1. Server side apps by 3 different approaches
  1.1 GraphQL Server side app in NodeJS
  1.2 GraphQL Server side app with expressJS + official GraphQL (TO LEARN in a day or 2)
    1.2.1 using buildSchema approach 
    1.2.2 using graphQLSchema
  1.3 GraphQL Server side app with  expressJS + Appolo Server (TO LEARN)

2. Client side app
  Angular/React/vueJS/svelte App with either Appolo client or Facebook Relay

  What we will develop
  React App with Appolo Client (TO LEARN)

GraphQL is a language neutral feature/ concept

Day 11-
On the Server side 
===========

#1 Running GraphQL in a Node.js environment
    https://graphql.org/graphql-js/

#2 GraphQL API server over an Express webserver. 
    https://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server/

#3 GraphQL server packages from Apollo that work with 
    various Node.js HTTP frameworks like Express 
    https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/


On the client Side 
================
#1 Using Apollo Client  (We will have demo of this one only)
    A powerful JavaScript GraphQL client, designed to work well with React, 
    React Native, Angular 2, or just plain JavaScript.
    http://apollographql.com/client/ 

#2 Using Facebook Relay ( You learn this separately)
    Facebook's framework for building React applications that 
    talk to a GraphQL backend.
